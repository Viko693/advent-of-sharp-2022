I have made the decision to add "_disabled" 
to the main function of each separate script whenever not in use
so I can avoid running every solution simultaneously
To run the script you wish to test, simply remove the "_disabled" snippet from its 
respective <Main> function , while also making sure only one <main> function is running.
